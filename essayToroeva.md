**1.	Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**


My name is Chynara. I am 37 years old. My country is Kyrgyzstan - small post-Soviet country where more than 80 percent of the population are Muslims. Women generally in my country do not work after marriage, stay at home and raise their children, doing household chores. Men work and earn money for the family.  

I was born and raised in a small remote Kyrgyz village. Only Kyrgyz lived in our village. So I was able to speak only in the Kyrgyz language. After high school, all my girl-classmates are married, because their parents could not pay for their daughterâ€™s studying at universities. Of all the graduates of our class only 2 boys and I came to the university to pursue higher education.  

I entered the Faculty of Informatics. Thanks a lot my parents. While studying at the university I learned  Russian language, and first time I saw the computer. It was interesting to work on computer. I graduated my university with honors.  

My current work is also associated with information technology, I will implement projects in the field of information technology and communications. My organization hires programmers to write computer programs. They are really cool.  Programmers earn a lot. They can create sites on internet, programms for mobile phone ets.  They are usually Russian men. Kyrgyz women - programmers I never met.  

In our country, it  is not possible to Kyrgyz women, who live in the villages to get a good education. They do not know foreign languages, how to use internet, do not believe in yourself, because our society requires them only to have children and to feed her husband and family. I am one of them, but I am proud  that at now I  work in the specialty.


At now almost all the people in my country think that women can not become a good programmer.10 years ago I had a dream to become a programmer. At that time I was teaching computer science to students. To realize my dream, I started to learn English, as codes must be written in English.


I searched courses, but to pay for these courses I had no money. I did not even have a computer. It was difficult to understand the programming languages terms. Also I had not mentor who would advice me how to start learning progrmming.  So I decided for myself that I never can not become a programmer and stopped to study programming languages.


But in 2016 I found on Internet Ada developers Academy website, looked that woman completely unaware of the computer for a short time changed professions and became programmers. It inspired me, now I want to realize my dream. That is why I am learning English, I will apply to join the Ada Developers Academy Family.

**2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**  

If ADA Developers Academy mentors will allow me to study in their wonderful Academy I will try to become a good student. And I'm sure that will graduate from the academy with good grades.  

In five years I will be 42 years old, but I see myself as the CEO of software development company in Kyrgyzstan. Because now I feel like a 22 year age girl, I'm always full of optimism and strength.  

And I will create a free online course for women programming for  women and girls who want to be a programmer.

**3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?**   


I like the Ada Developers Academy to help women explore programming and realize himself as a person. 
I have a plan to create a free online course for women programming in Kyrgyz languages, because it is difficult to women who do not know enough Russian and English languages to understand programming code andlearning materials in Russian and English. I will help girls and women who have no money and no opportunity to learn programming and become a programmer. We will create a community of cool women programmers! We will  help each other to earn money for our life through knowledge and become happier!

**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**  


Now I am very much regret that 10 years ago I gave up my dream to become a programmer. If those days I was more stubborn and harder maybe I would be a  programmer and  now to do things what I really like. Now I bought a computer, I have the Internet. I apply for Ada Developers Academy.  Now I will not be ashamed that I am a kyrgyz woman.
